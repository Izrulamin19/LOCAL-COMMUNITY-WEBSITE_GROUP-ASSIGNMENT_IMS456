                    <h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Pangkor Island Floating Mosque</h2>
                    
                        <p id="Pangkor Island Floating Mosque">
                            Whenever we talk about Pangkor Island, it is inevitable that we relate to the events that occurred involving before, 
                            after and the effects of the Pangkor Agreement. 
                            The Pangkor Treaty of 1874 was a treaty signed between Great Britain and the Sultan of Perak on 20 January 1874, on HMS Pluto,
                            off the coast of Perak. The treaty is significant in the history of the Malay states as it legitimised British control of the Malay rulers 
                            and paved the way for British imperialism in Malaya. It was the result of a multi-day conference organised by Andrew Clarke, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, 
                            to solve two problems: the Larut War, and Sultanship in Perak.

                <div class="card" id="section1">
                    <h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">Explore the Pangkor Rainforest with ATV.</h2>
                    
                        <p id="Explore the Pangkor Rainforest with ATV.">
                            Join an ATV Pangkor trip to see the natural beauty of Pangkor (from RM80 per person). The two-hour ride begins in Coral Bay and winds through the interior's difficult roads into Bukit Pangkor, 
                            ascending all the way to Pangkor's ancient airfield.  You'll fully understand Pangkor's different attractions when you approach the water at the uninhabited northern beach Teluk Dalam.
                       </p>

                        <p id="You may feed wild hornbills with your own hands">
                            The regular hornbill feeding staged by budget hotel Sunset View Chalet at 6.30 p.m. in one of Teluk Nipah's two back roads is obvious.
                             A flock of 20 or more hungry birds eagerly wait on the powerlines for the guesthouse owners' daily fruit feast. They attack any courageous traveler who tries to hoist a slice of fruit into the air.
                             It's thrilling to see the birds fly down to steal the prized pineapple from our grasp.
                             The best part is that the show is free, and you are certain to witness the majestic birds.

                        <p id="Kota Belanda">
                            The Dutch Fort (Kota Belanda) on the island's southeastern tip is a modest reminder of Pangkor's colonial heritage. Built in 1670 by the Dutch to store supplies and regulate the tin trade in Perak, it was destroyed by locals in 1690,
                             rebuilt by the Dutch as a military stronghold in 1743, and eventually abandoned in 1748.The majority of what you see now was reconstructed in 1973 for conservation and tourist interests.

                        <p id="Batu Bersurat">
                            Across the road from Kota Belanda sits Pangkor's most renowned boulder, Batu Bersurat, also known as "tiger rock" because of the writing on it. The grey stone, sheltered by a pavilion, bears an ambiguous sculpture of a huge cat: to some, it's a tiger mauling a kid, 
                            a tribute to the tragic death of a Dutch dignitary's son; to others, it's the cryptic lion from the Dutch coat of arms, carrying an arrow quiver and a sword. The clear "VoC" etching, a hallmark of the Dutch East India Company, casts little question about the veracity of the second choice.
