                        <h2 style="color: black;">Pangkor Island's People </h2>
                        <p> Pangkor Island's population in 2021 is estimated at 25,000 with major are from ethnic groups of Malay, Chinese, Indian
                            As is the case with Malaysia, most of the people here are of Malay descent while there are some Chinese and Indians as well although Chinese religions and Hinduism
                             are practised in Pangkor Island by a good strength of the population. People here are friendly, but it is advisable to dress modestly as this island is a family resort for many locals. 
                             There are many seafood establishments all along the populated areas of Pangkor, which offer good quality food at affordable prices.

                        <h2 style="color: black;">Pangkor Island's Culture </h2>
                        <p> Pangkor Island is primarily a fishing and tourist town which shares many of the common cultural attributes with Perak and Peninsular Malaysia. Before the tourism industry flourished, this island was primarily a fishing village.
                             However, after the growth of tourism, many Malaysians of Chinese and Indian ancestry came here which added diversity to this place.
                             <br>
                             Since the Malays are Muslim, most of the important Islamic religious events are celebrated here. Chinese and Hindu festivals are also celebrated on the island owing to its sizeable population of both ethnicities. As far as cuisine on the island is concerned,
                             it primarily revolves around seafood. However, appearances can be deceiving, so don't judge a small and run-down food shack as this could be where you taste the best local delicacy.
                             <br>
                             Malay is the native tongue of most people on Pangkor island. There are some people of Chinese descent here on the island who speak various Chinese language dialects such as Teochew, Hokkien, and others. Tamil is also spoken by a small minority of people who are of Indian descent. 
                             Due to the prevalence of the tourism industry, English too is widely spoken and understood on Pangkor Island.
